# Trader Application

Trader App that I completed in April, 2022. Allows users to register accounts and add products that they are advertising for trade.

Allows users to leave reviews and feedback on products.

# Technologies/libraries used

Used Node/Express and built using MVC design pattern. 

MongoDB/Mongoose was used as the database to store information about the Product, User, and Review Schemas. 

Used EJS for templating and CSS/Bootstrap for styling.

Utilized Joi for validation and passport.js for authentication. 

Helmet was used as a middleware to add security to the application.
